# Adobe-Runtime-Support

Report, track and discuss issues in the Adobe AIR/Flash Runtimes.
_Maintained by the **Starling community**, monitored by **Adobe**._

This repository does not contain any source code; instead, it's intended to act as an **issue tracker** for bugs and feature requests connected to the *Adobe AIR* and *Flash* runtimes.

Adobe does have its own issue tracker for these matters, namely [Adobe Tracker](https://tracker.adobe.com).
This GitHub project is not intended to _replace_ this tracker, but to _complement_ it.

## Why another Issue Tracker?

Adobe's tracker has several deficiencies:

* It's hard to search through its tickets. As a result, equivalent bugs often get reported repeatedly, and they don't get the attention they deserve.
* It's hard to start a constructive discussion in its comment system.
* Its email notification system provides too little control.
* Text and source code are often hard to read, due to a lack of Markdown and syntax highlighting.

This GitHub-powered issue tracker, on the other hand, has all the powerful features the open source community is accustomed to.

## I found a bug in the runtime! What do do?!

First of all, use the search feature to find out if somebody already reported a similar issue.

### a) This issue was already reported.

* Vote for that issue. To do that, click on the "Add your reaction" button at the top of the first comment and pick the :+1: symbol.
* If possible, provide additional information by adding a comment.
* **Important:** also head over to the respective [Adobe Tracker](https://tracker.adobe.com) issue (there should be a link in the GitHub issue) and add your vote there, too.

### b) This is a new issue.

* Collect as much information about the problem as possible. Don't worry: when you open up the issue, a template will make sure you don't forget anything vital.
* Only a problem that can be reproduced has a chance of being fixed! Thus, create a minimal sample and provide all the information needed to get it running.
* I can't stress this enough: the easier you make it for Adobe to recreate the problem, the higher your chances of a fix!

When you are finished, head over to [Adobe Tracker](https://tracker.adobe.com) and try to find similar issues:

* Either vote for existing issues, or create a new one (with all the information you just added here).
* Make sure that the GitHub issue contains links to the Adobe Tracker issue(s), and the other way round.
