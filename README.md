# Adobe-Runtime-Support

This project acts purely as an **issue tracker** for bugs and feature requests connected to the *Adobe AIR* and *Flash* runtimes.
It does not contain any source code.

The official [Adobe Tracker](https://tracker.adobe.com) is rather cumbersome and limited.
For example, it's really hard to search through tickets, so bugs often get reported repeatedly; as a result, they often don't get the attention they deserve.

With this alternative tracker, the [Starling Framework](https://gamua.com/starling) community can better discuss issues and make sure Adobe knows what's relevant for us.
It's not intended to _replace_ the official bug tracker, but to _complement_ it.

## I found a bug in the runtime! What do do?!

First of all, use the search feature to find out if somebody already reported a similar issue.

### a) This issue was already reported.

* Vote for that issue. To do that, click on the "Add your reaction" button at the top of the issue description and click on the :+1: symbol.
* If possible, provide additional information by adding a comment.
* **Important:** also head over to the respective [Adobe Tracker](https://tracker.adobe.com) issue (there should be a link in the GitHub issue) and add your vote there, too.

### b) This is a new issue.

* Create a [new issue](https://github.com/Gamua/Adobe-Runtime-Support/issues/new) in this repository.
* A template will pop up that will help you collect all necessary information.
* Only a problem that can be reproduced has a chance of being fixed! Thus, create a minimal sample and provide all the information needed to get it running.
* I can't stress this enough: the easier you make it for Adobe to recreate the problem, the higher your chances of a fix!

When you are finished, head over to [Adobe Tracker](https://tracker.adobe.com) and try to find similar issues. Then:

* Either vote for existing issues, or create a new one (with all the information you just added here).
* Make sure that the GitHub issue contains links to the Adobe Tracker issue(s), and the other way round.
