## Problem Description

Describe your problem in detail. Include the following information:

* Which AIR SDK did you use? Hint: always try the latest version from [Adobe Labs](http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/air.html).
* Describe the affected environment: Flash vs. AIR, Android vs. iOS, all devices vs. just specific models.
* Can you reproduce it yourself, or did you get reports from other users? If so, how many users are affected (percentage)?
* If applicable, link to the Starling/Feathers issues that brought you here.

Furthermore, **always** add a link to one or more analog [Adobe Tracker](https://tracker.adobe.com) issues. This repository is not a replacement for Adobe's bug tracker!

## Steps to Reproduce

Tell us how this issue can be reproduced. Seriously: if you want this issue to be fixed, this is the part you **really** need to get nailed.
Give us a minimal example:

* As little code as possible. Get to the root of the problem!
* As few dependencies as possible. Did the problem pop up with Feathers? Try to reproduce it with Starling only.
* Remove any ANEs (except if they are vital for the problem).
* Include all necessary files (e.g. textures).
